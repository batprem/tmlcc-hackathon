Anything I should not put in here?**\n\nPlease don't install `jupyter` or `jedi` packages, they would break your Deepnote environment. Also, no need to put `!pip install`s here, we already save those automatically!\n\n**I want to learn more!**\n\nGreat! Just [head over to our docs](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/custom-initialization).",
